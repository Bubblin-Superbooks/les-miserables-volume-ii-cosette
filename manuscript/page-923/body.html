She had hardly begun to regain her confidence since she had been with Jean Valjean. She speedily became accustomed to the convent. Only she regretted Catherine, but she dared not say so. Once, however, she did say to Jean Valjean: &ldquo;Father, if I had known, I would have brought her away with me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
