<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The barrier was close at hand. In 1823 the city wall was still in existence.</p><p>This barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind. It was the road to BicÃªtre. It was through it that, under the Empire and the Restoration, prisoners condemned to death re-entered Paris on the day of their execution. It was there, that, about 1829, was committed that mysterious assassination, called &ldquo;The assassination of the Fontainebleau barrier,&rdquo; whose authors justice was never able to discover; a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated, a frightful enigma which has never been unriddled. Take a few steps, and you come upon that fatal Rue Croulebarbe, where Ulbach stabbed the goat-girl of Ivry to the sound of thunder, as in the melodramas.</p></div> </div>
