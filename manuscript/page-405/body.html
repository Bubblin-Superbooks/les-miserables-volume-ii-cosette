What money is that? Take back your hundred-sou piece. I adore the child.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whom do you mean?&rdquo; demanded the stranger.</p><p>&ldquo;Eh! our little Cosette! Are you not intending to take her away from us? Well, I speak frankly; as true as you are an honest man, I will not consent to it. I shall miss that child. I saw her first when she was a tiny thing. It is true that she costs us money; it is true that she has her faults; it is true that we are not rich; it is true that I have paid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her illnesses! But one must do something for the good God&rsquo;s sake.</p></div> </div>
