Napoleon indulged in many fits of this laughter during the breakfast at Waterloo. After breakfast he meditated for a quarter of an hour; then two generals seated themselves on the truss of straw, pen in hand and their paper on their knees, and the Emperor dictated to them the order of battle.</p><p>At nine o&rsquo;clock, at the instant when the French army, ranged in echelons and set in motion in five columns, had deployed&mdash;the divisions in two lines, the artillery between the brigades, the music at their head; as they beat the march, with rolls on the drums and the blasts of trumpets, mighty, vast, joyous, a sea of casques, of sabres, and of bayonets on the horizon, the Emperor was touched, and twice exclaimed, &ldquo;Magnificent! Magnificent!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
