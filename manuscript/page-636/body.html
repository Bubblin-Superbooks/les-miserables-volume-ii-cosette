<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At each hour of the day three supplementary strokes sound from the church bell of the convent. At this signal prioress, vocal mothers, professed nuns, lay-sisters, novices, postulants, interrupt what they are saying, what they are doing, or what they are thinking, and all say in unison if it is five o&rsquo;clock, for instance, &ldquo;At five o&rsquo;clock and at all hours praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar!&rdquo; If it is eight o&rsquo;clock, &ldquo;At eight o&rsquo;clock and at all hours!&rdquo; and so on, according to the hour.</p><p>This custom, the object of which is to break the thread of thought and to lead it back constantly to God, exists in many communities; the formula alone varies. Thus at The Infant Jesus they say, &ldquo;At this hour and at every hour may the love of Jesus kindle my heart!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
