At the beginning of this century Écouen was one of those strict and graceful places where young girls pass their childhood in a shadow that is almost august. At Écouen, in order to take rank in the procession of the Holy Sacrament, a distinction was made between virgins and florists. There were also the &ldquo;dais&rdquo; and the &ldquo;censors,&rdquo;&mdash;the first who held the cords of the dais, and the others who carried incense before the Holy Sacrament. The flowers belonged by right to the florists. Four &ldquo;virgins&rdquo; walked in advance. On the morning of that great day it was no rare thing to hear the question put in the dormitory, &ldquo;Who is a virgin?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
