<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On the following morning, at daybreak, Jean Valjean was still by Cosette&rsquo;s bedside; he watched there motionless, waiting for her to wake.</p><p>Some new thing had come into his soul.</p><p>Jean Valjean had never loved anything; for twenty-five years he had been alone in the world. He had never been father, lover, husband, friend. In the prison he had been vicious, gloomy, chaste, ignorant, and shy. The heart of that ex-convict was full of virginity. His sister and his sister&rsquo;s children had left him only a vague and far-off memory which had finally almost completely vanished; he had made every effort to find them, and not having been able to find them, he had forgotten them. Human nature is made thus; the other tender emotions of his youth, if he had ever had any, had fallen into an abyss.</p></div> </div>
