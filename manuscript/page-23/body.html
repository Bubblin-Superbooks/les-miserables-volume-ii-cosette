Buildings which have since been pulled down then formed redans and angles.</p><p>The English barricaded themselves there; the French made their way in, but could not stand their ground. Beside the chapel, one wing of the château, the only ruin now remaining of the manor of Hougomont, rises in a crumbling state,&mdash;disembowelled, one might say.
