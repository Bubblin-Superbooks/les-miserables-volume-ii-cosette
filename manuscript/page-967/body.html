<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I would remind the district-attorney,&rdquo; said the President, &ldquo;that Police-Inspector Javert, recalled by his duties to the capital of a neighboring arrondissement, left the court-room and the town as soon as he had made his deposition; we have accorded him permission, with the consent of the district-attorney and of the counsel for the prisoner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true, Mr. President,&rdquo; responded the district-attorney. &ldquo;In the absence of sieur Javert, I think it my duty to remind the gentlemen of the jury of what he said here a few hours ago. Javert is an estimable man, who does honor by his rigorous and strict probity to inferior but important functions. These are the terms of his deposition: &lsquo;I do not even stand in need of circumstantial proofs and moral presumptions to give the lie to the prisoner&rsquo;s denial. I recognize him perfectly.</p></div> </div>
