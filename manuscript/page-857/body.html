<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The handle of a hammer, the blade of a cold chisel, and the antennæ of a pair of pincers were visible, protruding from the man&rsquo;s pocket.</p><p>The Vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of Paris. It had its peculiar usages, just as it had its carriage entrance and its house door, which old people in the quarter, who clung tenaciously to ancient words, still called the porte cavalière and the porte piétonne. The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Rue Petit-Picpus had obtained permission, as we have already stated, to be buried there in a corner apart, and at night, the plot of land having formerly belonged to their community. The grave-diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter, in this cemetery, they were subjected to a special discipline.</p></div> </div>
