<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I am not fond of grinding Breton wheat, any more than long-sawyers like to saw beams with nails in them. You can judge of the bad dust that makes in grinding. And then people complain of the flour. They are in the wrong.

It cuts better. Dew is a good thing, sir. It makes no difference with that grass. Your grass is young and very hard to cut still. It&rsquo;s terribly tender. It yields before the iron.&rdquo; Etc.</p></div> </div>
