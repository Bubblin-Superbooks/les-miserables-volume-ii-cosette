This practice of filling up corners of the wall is much in use in Paris.</p><p>This mass was about five feet in height; the space above the summit of this mass which it was necessary to climb was not more than fourteen feet.</p><p>The wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping.</p><p>Cosette was the difficulty, for she did not know how to climb a wall. Should he abandon her? Jean Valjean did not once think of that. It was impossible to carry her. A man&rsquo;s whole strength is required to successfully carry out these singular ascents. The least burden would disturb his centre of gravity and pull him downwards.</p></div> </div>
