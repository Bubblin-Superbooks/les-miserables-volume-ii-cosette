The Thénardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter. Cosette, from her post under the table, gazed at the fire, which was reflected from her fixed eyes. She had begun to rock the sort of baby which she had made, and, as she rocked it, she sang in a low voice, &ldquo;My mother is dead! my mother is dead! my mother is dead!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
