<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fauchelevent mopped his forehead.</p><p>The prioress indulged in another little inward murmur, probably sacred, then raised her voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;In her lifetime, Mother Crucifixion made converts; after her death, she will perform miracles.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She will!&rdquo; replied Father Fauchelevent, falling into step, and striving not to flinch again.</p><p>&ldquo;Father Fauvent, the community has been blessed in Mother Crucifixion. No doubt, it is not granted to every one to die, like Cardinal de BÃ©rulle, while saying the holy mass, and to breathe forth their souls to God, while pronouncing these words: Hanc igitur oblationem. But without attaining to such happiness, Mother Crucifixion&rsquo;s death was very precious. She retained her consciousness to the very last moment. She spoke to us, then she spoke to the angels. She gave us her last commands.</p></div> </div>
