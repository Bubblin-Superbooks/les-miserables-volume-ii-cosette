<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;He is dead!&rdquo;</p><p>And, drawing himself up, and folding his arms with such violence that his clenched fists came in contact with his shoulders, he cried:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And this is the way I save his life!&rdquo;</p><p>Then the poor man fell to sobbing. He soliloquized the while, for it is an error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural. Powerful emotion often talks aloud.</p><p>&ldquo;It is Father Mestienne&rsquo;s fault. Why did that fool die? What need was there for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one was expecting it? It is he who has killed M. Madeleine. Father Madeleine! He is in the coffin. It is quite handy. All is over. Now, is there any sense in these things? Ah! my God! he is dead! Well! and his little girl, what am I to do with her? What will the fruit-seller say? The idea of its being possible for a man like that to die like this!</p></div> </div>
