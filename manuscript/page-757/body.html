One draws a bill of exchange on death. One discounts in terrestrial gloom celestial light. In the cloister, hell is accepted in advance as a post obit on paradise.</p><p>The taking of the veil or the frock is a suicide paid for with eternity.</p><p>It does not seem to us, that on such a subject mockery is permissible. All about it is serious, the good as well as the bad.</p><p>The just man frowns, but never smiles with a malicious sneer. We understand wrath, but not malice.</p></div> </div>
