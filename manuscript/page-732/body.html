<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Nevertheless, at certain points and in certain places, in spite of philosophy, in spite of progress, the spirit of the cloister persists in the midst of the nineteenth century, and a singular ascetic recrudescence is, at this moment, astonishing the civilized world. The obstinacy of antiquated institutions in perpetuating themselves resembles the stubbornness of the rancid perfume which should claim our hair, the pretensions of the spoiled fish which should persist in being eaten, the persecution of the child&rsquo;s garment which should insist on clothing the man, the tenderness of corpses which should return to embrace the living.</p><p>&ldquo;Ingrates!&rdquo; says the garment, &ldquo;I protected you in inclement weather. Why will you have nothing to do with me?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have just come from the deep sea,&rdquo; says the fish. &ldquo;I have been a rose,&rdquo; says the perfume. &ldquo;I have loved you,&rdquo; says the corpse. &ldquo;I have civilized you,&rdquo; says the convent.</p></div> </div>
