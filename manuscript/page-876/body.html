Jean Valjean.</p><p>Jean Valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there, and he could almost breathe.</p><p>It is a strange thing to what a degree security of conscience confers security of the rest. Every combination thought out by Jean Valjean had been progressing, and progressing favorably, since the preceding day. He, like Fauchelevent, counted on Father Mestienne. He had no doubt as to the end. Never was there a more critical situation, never more complete composure.</p><p>The four planks of the coffin breathe out a kind of terrible peace. It seemed as though something of the repose of the dead entered into Jean Valjean&rsquo;s tranquillity.</p></div> </div>
