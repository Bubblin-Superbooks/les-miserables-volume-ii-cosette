Every evening, at twilight, he walked for an hour or two, sometimes alone, often with Cosette, seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard, and entering churches at nightfall. He liked to go to Saint-Médard, which is the nearest church. When he did not take Cosette with him, she remained with the old woman; but the child&rsquo;s delight was to go out with the good man.

He held her hand as they walked, and said sweet things to her.</p><p>It turned out that Cosette was a very gay little person.</p></div> </div>
