<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>So far in this book the Thénardiers have been viewed only in profile; the moment has arrived for making the circuit of this couple, and considering it under all its aspects.</p><p>Thénardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday; Madame Thénardier was approaching her forties, which is equivalent to fifty in a woman; so that there existed a balance of age between husband and wife.</p><p>Our readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this Thénardier woman, ever since her first appearance,&mdash;tall, blond, red, fat, angular, square, enormous, and agile; she belonged, as we have said, to the race of those colossal wild women, who contort themselves at fairs with paving-stones hanging from their hair. She did everything about the house,&mdash;made the beds, did the washing, the cooking, and everything else. Cosette was her only servant; a mouse in the service of an elephant.</p></div> </div>
