<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Now the Prussian general, Muffling, declares that one hour&rsquo;s delay, and Blücher would not have found Wellington on his feet. &ldquo;The battle was lost.&rdquo;</p><p>It was time that Bülow should arrive, as will be seen. He had, moreover, been very much delayed. He had bivouacked at Dion-le-Mont, and had set out at daybreak; but the roads were impassable, and his divisions stuck fast in the mire. The ruts were up to the hubs of the cannons. Moreover, he had been obliged to pass the Dyle on the narrow bridge of Wavre; the street leading to the bridge had been fired by the French, so the caissons and ammunition-wagons could not pass between two rows of burning houses, and had been obliged to wait until the conflagration was extinguished. It was midday before Bülow&rsquo;s vanguard had been able to reach Chapelle-Saint-Lambert.</p></div> </div>
