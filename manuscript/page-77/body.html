This did not prevent Napoleon from exclaiming cheerfully to Ney, &ldquo;We have ninety chances out of a hundred.&rdquo; At eight o&rsquo;clock the Emperor&rsquo;s breakfast was brought to him. He invited many generals to it. During breakfast, it was said that Wellington had been to a ball two nights before, in Brussels, at the Duchess of Richmond&rsquo;s; and Soult, a rough man of war, with a face of an archbishop, said, &ldquo;The ball takes place to-day.&rdquo; The Emperor jested with Ney, who said, &ldquo;Wellington will not be so simple as to wait for Your Majesty.&rdquo; That was his way, however. &ldquo;He was fond of jesting,&rdquo; says Fleury de Chaboulon.</p></div> </div>
