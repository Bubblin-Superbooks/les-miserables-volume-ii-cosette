<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> To-day, there are brand-new, wide streets, arenas, circuses, hippodromes, railway stations, and a prison, Mazas, there; progress, as the reader sees, with its antidote.</p><p>Half a century ago, in that ordinary, popular tongue, which is all compounded of traditions, which persists in calling the Institut les Quatre-Nations, and the Opera-Comique Feydeau, the precise spot whither Jean Valjean had arrived was called le Petit-Picpus. The Porte Saint-Jacques, the Porte Paris, the Barrière des Sergents, the Porcherons, la Galiote, les Célestins, les Capucins, le Mail, la Bourbe, l&rsquo;Arbre de Cracovie, la Petite-Pologne&mdash;these are the names of old Paris which survive amid the new. The memory of the populace hovers over these relics of the past.</p></div> </div>
