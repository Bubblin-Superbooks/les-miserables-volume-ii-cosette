Obedience, poverty, chastity, perseverance in their seclusion,&mdash;these are their vows, which the rule greatly aggravates.</p><p>The prioress is elected for three years by the mothers, who are called m√®res vocales because they have a voice in the chapter. A prioress can only be re-elected twice, which fixes the longest possible reign of a prioress at nine years.</p><p>They never see the officiating priest, who is always hidden from them by a serge curtain nine feet in height. During the sermon, when the preacher is in the chapel, they drop their veils over their faces. They must always speak low, walk with their eyes on the ground and their heads bowed. One man only is allowed to enter the convent,&mdash;the archbishop of the diocese.</p></div> </div>
