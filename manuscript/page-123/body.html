<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The painful surprise of Napoleon is well known. Grouchy hoped for, Bl端cher arriving. Death instead of life.</p><p>Fate has these turns; the throne of the world was expected; it was Saint Helena that was seen.</p><p>If the little shepherd who served as guide to B端low, Bl端cher&rsquo;s lieutenant, had advised him to debouch from the forest above Frischemont, instead of below Plancenoit, the form of the nineteenth century might, perhaps, have been different. Napoleon would have won the battle of Waterloo. By any other route than that below Plancenoit, the Prussian army would have come out upon a ravine impassable for artillery, and B端low would not have arrived.</p></div> </div>
