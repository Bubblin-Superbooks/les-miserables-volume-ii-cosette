<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This began the loss of the battle.</p><p>A local tradition, which evidently exaggerates matters, says that two thousand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in the hollow road of Ohain. This figure probably comprises all the other corpses which were flung into this ravine the day after the combat.</p><p>Let us note in passing that it was Dubois&rsquo;s sorely tried brigade which, an hour previously, making a charge to one side, had captured the flag of the Lunenburg battalion.</p><p>Napoleon, before giving the order for this charge of Milhaud&rsquo;s cuirassiers, had scrutinized the ground, but had not been able to see that hollow road, which did not even form a wrinkle on the surface of the plateau. Warned, nevertheless, and put on the alert by the little white chapel which marks its angle of junction with the Nivelles highway, he had probably put a question as to the possibility of an obstacle, to the guide Lacoste.</p></div> </div>
