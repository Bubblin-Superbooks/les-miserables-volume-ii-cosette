<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>To say: &ldquo;the plant wills,&rdquo; instead of: &ldquo;the plant grows&rdquo;: this would be fecund in results, indeed, if we were to add: &ldquo;the universe wills.&rdquo; Why? Because it would come to this: the plant wills, therefore it has an I; the universe wills, therefore it has a God.</p><p>As for us, who, however, in contradistinction to this school, reject nothing a priori, a will in the plant, accepted by this school, appears to us more difficult to admit than a will in the universe denied by it.</p><p>To deny the will of the infinite, that is to say, God, is impossible on any other conditions than a denial of the infinite. We have demonstrated this.</p></div> </div>
