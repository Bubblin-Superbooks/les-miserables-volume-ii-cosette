<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>So Cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword.</p><p>Madame Thénardier approached the yellow man; &ldquo;My husband is right,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;perhaps it is M. Laffitte; there are such queer rich men!&rdquo;</p><p>She came and set her elbows on the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said she. At this word, Monsieur, the man turned; up to that time, the Thénardier had addressed him only as brave homme or bonhomme.</p><p>&ldquo;You see, sir,&rdquo; she pursued, assuming a sweetish air that was even more repulsive to behold than her fierce mien, &ldquo;I am willing that the child should play; I do not oppose it, but it is good for once, because you are generous. You see, she has nothing; she must needs work.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
