<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Cosette shuddered, and pressed close to the old man.</p><p>He replied, gazing to the very bottom of Th√©nardier&rsquo;s eyes the while, and enunciating every syllable distinctly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You are go-ing to take back Co-sette?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I am. I will tell you; I have considered the matter. In fact, I have not the right to give her to you. I am an honest man, you see; this child does not belong to me; she belongs to her mother. It was her mother who confided her to me; I can only resign her to her mother. You will say to me, &lsquo;But her mother is dead.&rsquo; Good; in that case I can only give the child up to the person who shall bring me a writing, signed by her mother, to the effect that I am to hand the child over to the person therein mentioned; that is clear.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
