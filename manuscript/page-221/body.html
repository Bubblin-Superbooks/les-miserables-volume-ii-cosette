<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One morning, when Boulatruelle was on his way to his work, at daybreak, he had been surprised to see, at a nook of the forest in the underbrush, a shovel and a pickaxe, concealed, as one might say.</p><p>However, he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel and pick of Father Six-Fours, the water-carrier, and would have thought no more about it. But, on the evening of that day, he saw, without being seen himself, as he was hidden by a large tree, &ldquo;a person who did not belong in those parts, and whom he, Boulatruelle, knew well,&rdquo; directing his steps towards the densest part of the wood. Translation by Th√©nardier: A comrade of the galleys. Boulatruelle obstinately refused to reveal his name. This person carried a package&mdash;something square, like a large box or a small trunk. Surprise on the part of Boulatruelle.</p></div> </div>
