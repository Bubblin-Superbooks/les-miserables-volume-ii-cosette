<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On the afternoon of that same Christmas Day, 1823, a man had walked for rather a long time in the most deserted part of the Boulevard de l&rsquo;HÃ´pital in Paris. This man had the air of a person who is seeking lodgings, and he seemed to halt, by preference, at the most modest houses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg Saint-Marceau.</p><p>We shall see further on that this man had, in fact, hired a chamber in that isolated quarter.</p><p>This man, in his attire, as in all his person, realized the type of what may be called the well-bred mendicant,&mdash;extreme wretchedness combined with extreme cleanliness. This is a very rare mixture which inspires intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels for the man who is very poor, and for the man who is very worthy.</p></div> </div>
