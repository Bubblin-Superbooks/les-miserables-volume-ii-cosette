From this he had drawn the inference that this person, once in the forest, had dug a hole with his pick, buried the coffer, and reclosed the hole with his shovel. Now, the coffer was too small to contain a body; therefore it contained money. Hence his researches. Boulatruelle had explored, sounded, searched the entire forest and the thicket, and had dug wherever the earth appeared to him to have been recently turned up. In vain.</p><p>He had &ldquo;ferreted out&rdquo; nothing. No one in Montfermeil thought any more about it. There were only a few brave gossips, who said, &ldquo;You may be certain that the mender on the Gagny road did not take all that trouble for nothing; he was sure that the devil had come.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
