<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At the epoch when this story takes place, a boarding-school was attached to the convent&mdash;a boarding-school for young girls of noble and mostly wealthy families, among whom could be remarked Mademoiselle de Saint-Aulaire and de Bélissen, and an English girl bearing the illustrious Catholic name of Talbot. These young girls, reared by these nuns between four walls, grew up with a horror of the world and of the age. One of them said to us one day, &ldquo;The sight of the street pavement made me shudder from head to foot.&rdquo; They were dressed in blue, with a white cap and a Holy Spirit of silver gilt or of copper on their breast. On certain grand festival days, particularly Saint Martha&rsquo;s day, they were permitted, as a high favor and a supreme happiness, to dress themselves as nuns and to carry out the offices and practice of Saint-Benoît for a whole day.</p></div> </div>
