This plan would have succeeded if the four companies of the English guards and the brave Belgians of Perponcher&rsquo;s division had not held the position solidly, and Wellington, instead of massing his troops there, could confine himself to despatching thither, as reinforcements, only four more companies of guards and one battalion from Brunswick.</p></div> </div>
