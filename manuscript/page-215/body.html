<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> what does he find? What is the devil&rsquo;s treasure? A sou, sometimes a crown-piece, a stone, a skeleton, a bleeding body, sometimes a spectre folded in four like a sheet of paper in a portfolio, sometimes nothing. This is what Tryphon&rsquo;s verses seem to announce to the indiscreet and curious:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Fodit, et in fossa thesauros condit opaca, As, nummas, lapides, cadaver, simulacra, nihilque.&rdquo;</p><p>It seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powder-horn with bullets, sometimes an old pack of cards greasy and worn, which has evidently served the devil. Tryphon does not record these two finds, since Tryphon lived in the twelfth century, and since the devil does not appear to have had the wit to invent powder before Roger Bacon&rsquo;s time, and cards before the time of Charles VI.</p></div> </div>
