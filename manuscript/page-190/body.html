<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>s sword useless, men beneath one, horses on top of one; to struggle in vain, since one&rsquo;s bones have been broken by some kick in the darkness; to feel a heel which makes one&rsquo;s eyes start from their sockets; to bite horses&rsquo; shoes in one&rsquo;s rage; to stifle, to yell, to writhe; to be beneath, and to say to one&rsquo;s self, &ldquo;But just a little while ago I was a living man!&rdquo;</p><p>There, where that lamentable disaster had uttered its death-rattle, all was silence now. The edges of the hollow road were encumbered with horses and riders, inextricably heaped up. Terrible entanglement! There was no longer any slope, for the corpses had levelled the road with the plain, and reached the brim like a well-filled bushel of barley.</p></div> </div>
