The artillery would have been lost among the morasses. The retreat, according to many a man versed in the art,&mdash;though it is disputed by others,&mdash;would have been a disorganized flight.</p><p>To this centre, Wellington added one of Chass√©&lsquo;s brigades taken from the right wing, and one of Wincke&rsquo;s brigades taken from the left wing, plus Clinton&rsquo;s division. To his English, to the regiments of Halkett, to the brigades of Mitchell, to the guards of Maitland, he gave as reinforcements and aids, the infantry of Brunswick, Nassau&rsquo;s contingent, Kielmansegg&rsquo;s Hanoverians, and Ompteda&rsquo;s Germans. This placed twenty-six battalions under his hand. The right wing, as Charras says, was thrown back on the centre.</p></div> </div>
