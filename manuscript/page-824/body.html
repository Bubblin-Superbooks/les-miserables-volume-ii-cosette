Is not the body of Saint Benoît himself in France, in the abbey of Fleury, called Saint Benoît-sur-Loire, although he died in Italy at Mont-Cassin, on Saturday, the 21st of the month of March, of the year 543? All this is incontestable. I abhor psalm-singers, I hate priors, I execrate heretics, but I should detest yet more any one who should maintain the contrary. One has only to read Arnoul Wion, Gabriel Bucelin, Trithemus, Maurolics, and Dom Luc d&rsquo;Achery.&rdquo;</p><p>The prioress took breath, then turned to Fauchelevent.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it settled, Father Fauvent?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
