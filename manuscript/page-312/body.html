Towards two o&rsquo;clock, almost invariably, the royal carriage and cavalcade was seen to pass at full speed along the Boulevard de l&rsquo;HÃ´pital.</p><p>This served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women of the quarter who said, &ldquo;It is two o&rsquo;clock; there he is returning to the Tuileries.&rdquo;</p><p>And some rushed forward, and others drew up in line, for a passing king always creates a tumult; besides, the appearance and disappearance of Louis XVIII. produced a certain effect in the streets of Paris. It was rapid but majestic.
