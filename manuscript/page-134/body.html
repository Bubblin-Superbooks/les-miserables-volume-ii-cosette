<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> the worst of hand-to-hand conflicts is the defeat; friends kill each other in order to escape; squadrons and battalions break and disperse against each other, like the tremendous foam of battle. Lobau at one extremity, and Reille at the other, are drawn into the tide. In vain does Napoleon erect walls from what is left to him of his Guard; in vain does he expend in a last effort his last serviceable squadrons. Quiot retreats before Vivian, Kellermann before Vandeleur, Lobau before BÃ¼low, Morand before Pirch, Domon and Subervic before Prince William of Prussia; Guyot, who led the Emperor&rsquo;s squadrons to the charge, falls beneath the feet of the English dragoons. Napoleon gallops past the line of fugitives, harangues, urges, threatens, entreats them. All the mouths which in the morning had shouted, &ldquo;Long live the Emperor!&rdquo; remain gaping; they hardly recognize him.</p></div> </div>
