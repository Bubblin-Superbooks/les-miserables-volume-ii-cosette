On the 18th of June, 1815, his family fled and concealed themselves in the woods.</p><p>The forest surrounding the Abbey of Villiers sheltered these unfortunate people who had been scattered abroad, for many days and nights. There are at this day certain traces recognizable, such as old boles of burned trees, which mark the site of these poor bivouacs trembling in the depths of the thickets.</p><p>Guillaume van Kylsom remained at Hougomont, &ldquo;to guard the ch√¢teau,&rdquo; and concealed himself in the cellar. The English discovered him there. They tore him from his hiding-place, and the combatants forced this frightened man to serve them, by administering blows with the flats of their swords. They were thirsty; this Guillaume brought them water.</p></div> </div>
