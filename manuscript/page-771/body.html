<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The incomprehensible had just made its entrance into Fauchelevent&rsquo;s hut. Fauchelevent groped about amid conjectures, and could see nothing clearly but this: &ldquo;M. Madeleine saved my life.&rdquo; This certainty alone was sufficient and decided his course. He said to himself: &ldquo;It is my turn now.&rdquo; He added in his conscience: &ldquo;M. Madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it was a question of thrusting himself under the cart for the purpose of dragging me out.&rdquo; He made up his mind to save M. Madeleine.</p><p>Nevertheless, he put many questions to himself and made himself divers replies: &ldquo;After what he did for me, would I save him if he were a thief? Just the same. If he were an assassin, would I save him? Just the same. Since he is a saint, shall I save him? Just the same.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
