<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The doll is one of the most imperious needs and, at the same time, one of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood. To care for, to clothe, to deck, to dress, to undress, to redress, to teach, scold a little, to rock, to dandle, to lull to sleep, to imagine that something is some one,&mdash;therein lies the whole woman&rsquo;s future. While dreaming and chattering, making tiny outfits, and baby clothes, while sewing little gowns, and corsages and bodices, the child grows into a young girl, the young girl into a big girl, the big girl into a woman. The first child is the continuation of the last doll.</p><p>A little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy, and quite as impossible, as a woman without children.</p></div> </div>
