<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A few words more.</p><p>We blame the church when she is saturated with intrigues, we despise the spiritual which is harsh toward the temporal; but we everywhere honor the thoughtful man.</p><p>We salute the man who kneels.</p><p>A faith; this is a necessity for man. Woe to him who believes nothing.</p><p>One is not unoccupied because one is absorbed. There is visible labor and invisible labor.</p><p>To contemplate is to labor, to think is to act.</p><p>Folded arms toil, clasped hands work. A gaze fixed on heaven is a work.</p></div> </div>
