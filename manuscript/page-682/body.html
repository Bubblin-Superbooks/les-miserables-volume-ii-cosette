However, the useful virtue attached to these verses forms an article of faith in the order of the Hospitallers.</p><p>The church of the house, constructed in such a manner as to separate the Great Convent from the Boarding-school like a veritable intrenchment, was, of course, common to the Boarding-school, the Great Convent, and the Little Convent.</p></div> </div>
