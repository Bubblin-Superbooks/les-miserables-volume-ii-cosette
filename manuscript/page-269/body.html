<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Every newcomer who entered the tavern said, on catching sight of Madame Thénardier, &ldquo;There is the master of the house.&rdquo; A mistake. She was not even the mistress. The husband was both master and mistress. She worked; he created. He directed everything by a sort of invisible and constant magnetic action. A word was sufficient for him, sometimes a sign; the mastodon obeyed. Thénardier was a sort of special and sovereign being in Madame Thénardier&rsquo;s eyes, though she did not thoroughly realize it. She was possessed of virtues after her own kind; if she had ever had a disagreement as to any detail with &ldquo;Monsieur Thénardier,&rdquo;&mdash;which was an inadmissible hypothesis, by the way,&mdash;she would not have blamed her husband in public on any subject whatever.</p></div> </div>
