<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The cuirassiers hurled themselves on the English squares.</p><p>At full speed, with bridles loose, swords in their teeth, pistols in fist,&mdash;such was the attack.</p><p>There are moments in battles in which the soul hardens the man until the soldier is changed into a statue, and when all this flesh turns into granite. The English battalions, desperately assaulted, did not stir.</p><p>Then it was terrible.</p><p>All the faces of the English squares were attacked at once. A frenzied whirl enveloped them. That cold infantry remained impassive. The first rank knelt and received the cuirassiers on their bayonets, the second ranks shot them down; behind the second rank the cannoneers charged their guns, the front of the square parted, permitted the passage of an eruption of grape-shot, and closed again. The cuirassiers replied by crushing them.</p></div> </div>
