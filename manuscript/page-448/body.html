<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A portion of this building has recently been demolished. From what still remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in former days. As a whole, it was not over a hundred years old. A hundred years is youth in a church and age in a house. It seems as though man&rsquo;s lodging partook of his ephemeral character, and God&rsquo;s house of his eternity.</p><p>The postmen called the house Number 50-52; but it was known in the neighborhood as the Gorbeau house.</p><p>Let us explain whence this appellation was derived.</p><p>Collectors of petty details, who become herbalists of anecdotes, and prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin, know that there was in Paris, during the last century, about 1770, two attorneys at the Ch√¢telet named, one Corbeau (Raven), the other Renard (Fox). The two names had been forestalled by La Fontaine.</p></div> </div>
