She was in rags; her bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes, and by the firelight she was engaged in knitting woollen stockings destined for the young Thénardiers. A very young kitten was playing about among the chairs. Laughter and chatter were audible in the adjoining room, from two fresh children&rsquo;s voices: it was Éponine and Azelma.</p><p>In the chimney-corner a cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails was hanging on a nail.</p><p>At intervals the cry of a very young child, which was somewhere in the house, rang through the noise of the dram-shop. It was a little boy who had been born to the Thénardiers during one of the preceding winters,&mdash;&ldquo;she did not know why,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the result of the cold,&rdquo;&mdash;and who was a little more than three years old.</p></div> </div>
