As every one was in possession of the plateau, no one held it, and in fact it remained, to a great extent, with the English. Wellington held the village and the culminating plain; Ney had only the crest and the slope. They seemed rooted in that fatal soil on both sides.</p><p>But the weakening of the English seemed irremediable. The bleeding of that army was horrible. Kempt, on the left wing, demanded reinforcements. &ldquo;There are none,&rdquo; replied Wellington; &ldquo;he must let himself be killed!&rdquo; Almost at that same moment, a singular coincidence which paints the exhaustion of the two armies, Ney demanded infantry from Napoleon, and Napoleon exclaimed, &ldquo;Infantry! Where does he expect me to get it? Does he think I can make it?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
