I am playing,&rdquo; returned the child.</p><p>This stranger, this unknown individual, who had the air of a visit which Providence was making on Cosette, was the person whom the Thénardier hated worse than any one in the world at that moment. However, it was necessary to control herself. Habituated as she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions, these emotions were more than she could endure. She made haste to send her daughters to bed, then she asked the man&rsquo;s permission to send Cosette off also; &ldquo;for she has worked hard all day,&rdquo; she added with a maternal air. Cosette went off to bed, carrying Catherine in her arms.</p></div> </div>
