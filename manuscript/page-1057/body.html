<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One last word about Fantine.</p><p>We all have a mother,&mdash;the earth. Fantine was given back to that mother.</p><p>The cur√© thought that he was doing right, and perhaps he really was, in reserving as much money as possible from what Jean Valjean had left for the poor. Who was concerned, after all? A convict and a woman of the town. That is why he had a very simple funeral for Fantine, and reduced it to that strictly necessary form known as the pauper&rsquo;s grave.</p><p>So Fantine was buried in the free corner of the cemetery which belongs to anybody and everybody, and where the poor are lost. Fortunately, God knows where to find the soul again. Fantine was laid in the shade, among the first bones that came to hand; she was subjected to the promiscuousness of ashes. She was thrown into the public grave. Her grave resembled her bed.</p></div> </div>
