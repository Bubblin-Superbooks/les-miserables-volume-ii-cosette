<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Cosette and Jean Valjean fell on their knees.</p><p>They knew not what it was, they knew not where they were; but both of them, the man and the child, the penitent and the innocent, felt that they must kneel.</p><p>These voices had this strange characteristic, that they did not prevent the building from seeming to be deserted. It was a supernatural chant in an uninhabited house.</p><p>While these voices were singing, Jean Valjean thought of nothing. He no longer beheld the night; he beheld a blue sky. It seemed to him that he felt those wings which we all have within us, unfolding.</p><p>The song died away. It may have lasted a long time. Jean Valjean could not have told. Hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment.</p></div> </div>
