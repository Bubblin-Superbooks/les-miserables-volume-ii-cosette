<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The events of which we have just beheld the reverse side, so to speak, had come about in the simplest possible manner.</p><p>When Jean Valjean, on the evening of the very day when Javert had arrested him beside Fantine&rsquo;s death-bed, had escaped from the town jail of M. sur M., the police had supposed that he had betaken himself to Paris. Paris is a maelstrom where everything is lost, and everything disappears in this belly of the world, as in the belly of the sea. No forest hides a man as does that crowd. Fugitives of every sort know this. They go to Paris as to an abyss; there are gulfs which save. The police know it also, and it is in Paris that they seek what they have lost elsewhere. They sought the ex-mayor of M. sur M. Javert was summoned to Paris to throw light on their researches. Javert had, in fact, rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of Jean Valjean.</p></div> </div>
