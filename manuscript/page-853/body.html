<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The hearse halts, the undertaker&rsquo;s men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you down. The priest says the prayers, makes the sign of the cross, sprinkles the holy water, and takes his departure. I am left alone with Father Mestienne. He is my friend, I tell you. One of two things will happen, he will either be sober, or he will not be sober. If he is not drunk, I shall say to him: &lsquo;Come and drink a bout while the Bon Coing [the Good Quince] is open.&rsquo; I carry him off, I get him drunk,&mdash;it does not take long to make Father Mestienne drunk, he always has the beginning of it about him,&mdash;I lay him under the table, I take his card, so that I can get into the cemetery again, and I return without him. Then you have no longer any one but me to deal with. If he is drunk, I shall say to him: &lsquo;Be off; I will do your work for you.&rsquo; Off he goes, and I drag you out of the hole.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
