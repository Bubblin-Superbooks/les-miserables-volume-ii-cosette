<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Madeleine,&rdquo; resumed Fauchelevent, &ldquo;you have arrived at a very auspicious moment, I mean to say a very inauspicious moment; one of the ladies is very ill. This will prevent them from looking much in our direction. It seems that she is dying. The prayers of the forty hours are being said. The whole community is in confusion. That occupies them. The one who is on the point of departure is a saint. In fact, we are all saints here; all the difference between them and me is that they say &lsquo;our cell,&rsquo; and that I say &lsquo;my cabin.&rsquo; The prayers for the dying are to be said, and then the prayers for the dead. We shall be at peace here for to-day; but I will not answer for to-morrow.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
