<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The Arc du Carrousel, all laden with badly borne victories, thrown out of its element among these novelties, a little ashamed, it may be, of Marengo and Arcola, extricated itself from its predicament with the statue of the Duc d&rsquo;AngoulÃªme. The cemetery of the Madeleine, a terrible pauper&rsquo;s grave in 1793, was covered with jasper and marble, since the bones of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette lay in that dust.</p><p>In the moat of Vincennes a sepulchral shaft sprang from the earth, recalling the fact that the Duc d&rsquo;Enghien had perished in the very month when Napoleon was crowned. Pope Pius VII., who had performed the coronation very near this death, tranquilly bestowed his blessing on the fall as he had bestowed it on the elevation. At Schoenbrunn there was a little shadow, aged four, whom it was seditious to call the King of Rome.</p></div> </div>
