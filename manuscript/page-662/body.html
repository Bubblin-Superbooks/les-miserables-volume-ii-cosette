<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Above the door of the refectory this prayer, which was called the white Paternoster, and which possessed the property of bearing people straight to paradise, was inscribed in large black letters:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Little white Paternoster, which God made, which God said, which God placed in paradise. In the evening, when I went to bed, I found three angels sitting on my bed, one at the foot, two at the head, the good Virgin Mary in the middle, who told me to lie down without hesitation. The good God is my father, the good Virgin is my mother, the three apostles are my brothers, the three virgins are my sisters. The shirt in which God was born envelopes my body; Saint Margaret&rsquo;s cross is written on my breast. Madame the Virgin was walking through the meadows, weeping for God, when she met M. Saint John. &lsquo;Monsieur Saint John, whence come you?&rsquo; â€˜I come from Ave Salus.</p></div> </div>
