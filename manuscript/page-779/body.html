They would shriek: &lsquo;Oh! a man!&rsquo; There is no danger to-day. There will be no recreation hour. The day will be entirely devoted to prayers. You hear the bell. As I told you, a stroke each minute. It is the death knell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I understand, Father Fauchelevent. There are pupils.&rdquo;</p><p>And Jean Valjean thought to himself:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Here is Cosette&rsquo;s education already provided.&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Pardine! There are little girls indeed! And they would bawl around you! And they would rush off! To be a man here is to have the plague. You see how they fasten a bell to my paw as though I were a wild beast.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
