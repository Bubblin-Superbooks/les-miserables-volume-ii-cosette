<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Every person whatever is forbidden to shut herself up, to have a place of her own, a chamber. They live with their cells open. When they meet, one says, &ldquo;Blessed and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar!&rdquo; The other responds, &ldquo;Forever.&rdquo; The same ceremony when one taps at the other&rsquo;s door. Hardly has she touched the door when a soft voice on the other side is heard to say hastily, &ldquo;Forever!&rdquo; Like all practices, this becomes mechanical by force of habit; and one sometimes says forever before the other has had time to say the rather long sentence, &ldquo;Praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar.&rdquo;</p><p>Among the Visitandines the one who enters says: &ldquo;Ave Maria,&rdquo; and the one whose cell is entered says, &ldquo;Gratia plena.&rdquo; It is their way of saying good day, which is in fact full of grace.</p></div> </div>
