Behind the grating, behind the shutter, one perceived so far as the grating permitted sight, a head, of which only the mouth and the chin were visible; the rest was covered with a black veil. One caught a glimpse of a black guimpe, and a form that was barely defined, covered with a black shroud. That head spoke with you, but did not look at you and never smiled at you.</p><p>The light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner that you saw her in the white, and she saw you in the black. This light was symbolical.</p></div> </div>
