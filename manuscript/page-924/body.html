<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Cosette had been obliged, on becoming a scholar in the convent, to don the garb of the pupils of the house. Jean Valjean succeeded in getting them to restore to him the garments which she laid aside. This was the same mourning suit which he had made her put on when she had quitted the Th√©nardiers&rsquo; inn. It was not very threadbare even now. Jean Valjean locked up these garments, plus the stockings and the shoes, with a quantity of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound, in a little valise which he found means of procuring. He set this valise on a chair near his bed, and he always carried the key about his person. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; Cosette asked him one day, &ldquo;what is there in that box which smells so good?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
