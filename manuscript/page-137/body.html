<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The victory was completed by the assassination of the vanquished. Let us inflict punishment, since we are history: old Bl√ºcher disgraced himself. This ferocity put the finishing touch to the disaster. The desperate route traversed Genappe, traversed Quatre-Bras, traversed Gosselies, traversed Frasnes, traversed Charleroi, traversed Thuin, and only halted at the frontier. Alas! and who, then, was fleeing in that manner? The Grand Army.</p><p>This vertigo, this terror, this downfall into ruin of the loftiest bravery which ever astounded history,&mdash;is that causeless? No. The shadow of an enormous right is projected athwart Waterloo. It is the day of destiny. The force which is mightier than man produced that day. Hence the terrified wrinkle of those brows; hence all those great souls surrendering their swords. Those who had conquered Europe have fallen prone on the earth, with nothing left to say nor to do, feeling the present shadow of a terrible presence.</p></div> </div>
