<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The rout behind the Guard was melancholy.</p><p>The army yielded suddenly on all sides at once,&mdash;Hougomont, La Haie-Sainte, Papelotte, Plancenoit. The cry &ldquo;Treachery!&rdquo; was followed by a cry of &ldquo;Save yourselves who can!&rdquo; An army which is disbanding is like a thaw. All yields, splits, cracks, floats, rolls, falls, jostles, hastens, is precipitated. The disintegration is unprecedented. Ney borrows a horse, leaps upon it, and without hat, cravat, or sword, places himself across the Brussels road, stopping both English and French. He strives to detain the army, he recalls it to its duty, he insults it, he clings to the rout. He is overwhelmed. The soldiers fly from him, shouting, &ldquo;Long live Marshal Ney!&rdquo; Two of Durutte&rsquo;s regiments go and come in affright as though tossed back and forth between the swords of the Uhlans and the fusillade of the brigades of Kempt, Best, Pack, and Rylandt;</p></div> </div>
