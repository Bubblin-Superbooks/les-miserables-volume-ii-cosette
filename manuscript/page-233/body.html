<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The presence of a vessel of war in a port has something about it which attracts and engages a crowd. It is because it is great, and the crowd loves what is great.</p><p>A ship of the line is one of the most magnificent combinations of the genius of man with the powers of nature.</p><p>A ship of the line is composed, at the same time, of the heaviest and the lightest of possible matter, for it deals at one and the same time with three forms of substance,&mdash;solid, liquid, and fluid,&mdash;and it must do battle with all three. It has eleven claws of iron with which to seize the granite on the bottom of the sea, and more wings and more antenn√¶ than winged insects, to catch the wind in the clouds. Its breath pours out through its hundred and twenty cannons as through enormous trumpets, and replies proudly to the thunder.</p></div> </div>
