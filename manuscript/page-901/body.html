When I saw your eyes shut, I said: &lsquo;Good! there he is, stifled,&rsquo; I should have gone raving mad, mad enough for a strait jacket. They would have put me in BicÃªtre. What do you suppose I should have done if you had been dead? And your little girl? There&rsquo;s that fruit-seller,&mdash;she would never have understood it! The child is thrust into your arms, and then&mdash;the grandfather is dead! What a story! good saints of paradise, what a tale! Ah! you are alive, that&rsquo;s the best of it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am cold,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p></div> </div>
