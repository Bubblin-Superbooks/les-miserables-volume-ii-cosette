<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> one of the most elegant women in Paris. I quote literally: &ldquo;One hides one&rsquo;s pear or one&rsquo;s apple as best one may. When one goes upstairs to put the veil on the bed before supper, one stuffs them under one&rsquo;s pillow and at night one eats them in bed, and when one cannot do that, one eats them in the closet.&rdquo; That was one of their greatest luxuries.</p><p>Once&mdash;it was at the epoch of the visit from the archbishop to the convent&mdash;one of the young girls, Mademoiselle Bouchard, who was connected with the Montmorency family, laid a wager that she would ask for a day&rsquo;s leave of absence&mdash;an enormity in so austere a community. The wager was accepted, but not one of those who bet believed that she would do it.</p></div> </div>
