<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When one sees them, one never sees anything but their mouths.</p><p>All their teeth are yellow. No tooth-brush ever entered that convent. Brushing one&rsquo;s teeth is at the top of a ladder at whose bottom is the loss of one&rsquo;s soul.</p><p>They never say my. They possess nothing of their own, and they must not attach themselves to anything. They call everything our; thus: our veil, our chaplet; if they were speaking of their chemise, they would say our chemise. Sometimes they grow attached to some petty object,&mdash;to a book of hours, a relic, a medal that has been blessed. As soon as they become aware that they are growing attached to this object, they must give it up. They recall the words of Saint Thérèse, to whom a great lady said, as she was on the point of entering her order, &ldquo;Permit me, mother, to send for a Bible to which I am greatly attached.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, you are attached to something! In that case, do not enter our order!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
