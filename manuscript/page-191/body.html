<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A heap of dead bodies in the upper part, a river of blood in the lower part&mdash;such was that road on the evening of the 18th of June, 1815. The blood ran even to the Nivelles highway, and there overflowed in a large pool in front of the abatis of trees which barred the way, at a spot which is still pointed out.</p><p>It will be remembered that it was at the opposite point, in the direction of the Genappe road, that the destruction of the cuirassiers had taken place. The thickness of the layer of bodies was proportioned to the depth of the hollow road. Towards the middle, at the point where it became level, where Delort&rsquo;s division had passed, the layer of corpses was thinner.</p></div> </div>
