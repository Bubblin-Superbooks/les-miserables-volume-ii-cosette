Certainly, if Jean Valjean had had a kingdom, he would have given it for a rope at that moment.</p><p>All extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimes dazzle, sometimes illuminate us.</p><p>Jean Valjean&rsquo;s despairing glance fell on the street lantern-post of the blind alley Genrot.</p><p>At that epoch there were no gas-jets in the streets of Paris. At nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted; they were ascended and descended by means of a rope, which traversed the street from side to side, and was adjusted in a groove of the post. The pulley over which this rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a little iron box, the key to which was kept by the lamp-lighter, and the rope itself was protected by a metal case.</p></div> </div>
