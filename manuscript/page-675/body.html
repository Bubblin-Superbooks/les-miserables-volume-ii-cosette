<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was a flute which was played in the neighborhood. This flute always played the same air, an air which is very far away nowadays,&mdash;&ldquo;My Zétulbé, come reign o&rsquo;er my soul,&rdquo;&mdash;and it was heard two or three times a day. The young girls passed hours in listening to it, the vocal mothers were upset by it, brains were busy, punishments descended in showers. This lasted for several months. The girls were all more or less in love with the unknown musician. Each one dreamed that she was Zétulbé. The sound of the flute proceeded from the direction of the Rue Droit-Mur; and they would have given anything, compromised everything, attempted anything for the sake of seeing, of catching a glance, if only for a second, of the &ldquo;young man&rdquo; who played that flute so deliciously, and who, no doubt, played on all these souls at the same time.</p></div> </div>
