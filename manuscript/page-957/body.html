In the wheelwright&rsquo;s trade one works always in the open air, in courtyards, under sheds when the masters are good, never in closed workshops, because space is required, you see.

Handling iron when there is ice between the paving-stones is hard work. That wears a man out quickly. One is old while he is still quite young in that trade. At forty a man is done for. I was fifty-three.</p></div> </div>
