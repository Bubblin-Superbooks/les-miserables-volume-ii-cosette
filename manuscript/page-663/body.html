At the present time it is finally disappearing from the memories of several who were young girls then, and who are old women now.</p><p>A large crucifix fastened to the wall completed the decoration of this refectory, whose only door, as we think we have mentioned, opened on the garden. Two narrow tables, each flanked by two wooden benches, formed two long parallel lines from one end to the other of the refectory.</p></div> </div>
