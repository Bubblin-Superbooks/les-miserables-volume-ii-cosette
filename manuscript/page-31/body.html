One house in this ruin, the farmhouse, is still inhabited. The door of this house opens on the courtyard. Upon this door, beside a pretty Gothic lock-plate, there is an iron handle with trefoils placed slanting. At the moment when the Hanoverian lieutenant, Wilda, grasped this handle in order to take refuge in the farm, a French sapper hewed off his hand with an axe.</p><p>The family who occupy the house had for their grandfather Guillaume van Kylsom, the old gardener, dead long since. A woman with gray hair said to us: &ldquo;I was there. I was three years old. My sister, who was older, was terrified and wept. They carried us off to the woods. I went there in my mother&rsquo;s arms. We glued our ears to the earth to hear. I imitated the cannon, and went boum! boum!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
