The two men were warming themselves with their elbows resting on a table upon which Fauchelevent had placed a bit of cheese, black bread, a bottle of wine, and two glasses, and the old man was saying to Jean Valjean, as he laid his hand on the latter&rsquo;s knee: &ldquo;Ah! Father Madeleine! You did not recognize me immediately; you save people&rsquo;s lives, and then you forget them! That is bad! But they remember you! You are an ingrate!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
