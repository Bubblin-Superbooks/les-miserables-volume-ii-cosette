He wouldn&rsquo;t believe me. Well! Here&rsquo;s a pretty trick to play! He is dead, that good man, the very best man out of all the good God&rsquo;s good folks! And his little girl! Ah! In the first place, I won&rsquo;t go back there myself. I shall stay here. After having done such a thing as that! What&rsquo;s the use of being two old men, if we are two old fools! But, in the first place, how did he manage to enter the convent? That was the beginning of it all. One should not do such things. Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine! Madeleine! Monsieur Madeleine! Monsieur le Maire! He does not hear me. Now get out of this scrape if you can!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
