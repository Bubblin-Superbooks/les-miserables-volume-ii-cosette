<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Men unite themselves and dwell in communities. By virtue of what right? By virtue of the right of association.</p><p>They shut themselves up at home. By virtue of what right? By virtue of the right which every man has to open or shut his door.</p><p>They do not come forth. By virtue of what right? By virtue of the right to go and come, which implies the right to remain at home.</p><p>There, at home, what do they do?</p><p>They speak in low tones; they drop their eyes; they toil. They renounce the world, towns, sensualities, pleasures, vanities, pride, interests. They are clothed in coarse woollen or coarse linen. Not one of them possesses in his own right anything whatever. On entering there, each one who was rich makes himself poor. What he has, he gives to all. He who was what is called noble, a gentleman and a lord, is the equal of him who was a peasant.</p></div> </div>
