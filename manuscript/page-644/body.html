<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One is a postulant for two years at least, often for four; a novice for four. It is rare that the definitive vows can be pronounced earlier than the age of twenty-three or twenty-four years. The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga do not admit widows to their order.</p><p>In their cells, they deliver themselves up to many unknown macerations, of which they must never speak.</p><p>On the day when a novice makes her profession, she is dressed in her handsomest attire, she is crowned with white roses, her hair is brushed until it shines, and curled. Then she prostrates herself; a great black veil is thrown over her, and the office for the dead is sung. Then the nuns separate into two files; one file passes close to her, saying in plaintive accents, &ldquo;Our sister is dead&rdquo;; and the other file responds in a voice of ecstasy, &ldquo;Our sister is alive in Jesus Christ!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
