We do what we can for her, for we are not rich; we have written in vain to her native place, and have received no reply these six months. It must be that her mother is dead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the man, and fell into his reverie once more.</p><p>&ldquo;Her mother didn&rsquo;t amount to much,&rdquo; added the Th√©nardier; &ldquo;she abandoned her child.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
