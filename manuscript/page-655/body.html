They plucked the flowers and put them in their pockets. After that they plucked the leaves and put them in their playthings. There was a wolf in that country; there was a great deal of forest; and the wolf was in the forest; and he ate the little cocks.&rdquo;</p><p>And this other poem:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;There came a blow with a stick.</p><p>&ldquo;It was Punchinello who bestowed it on the cat.</p><p>&ldquo;It was not good for her; it hurt her.</p></div> </div>
