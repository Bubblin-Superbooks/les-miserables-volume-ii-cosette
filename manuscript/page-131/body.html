He had his fifth horse killed under him there. Perspiring, his eyes aflame, foaming at the mouth, with uniform unbuttoned, one of his epaulets half cut off by a sword-stroke from a horseguard, his plaque with the great eagle dented by a bullet; bleeding, bemired, magnificent, a broken sword in his hand, he said, &ldquo;Come and see how a Marshal of France dies on the field of battle!&rdquo; But in vain; he did not die. He was haggard and angry. At Drouet d&rsquo;Erlon he hurled this question, &ldquo;Are you not going to get yourself killed?&rdquo; In the midst of all that artillery engaged in crushing a handful of men, he shouted: &ldquo;So there is nothing for me! Oh! I should like to have all these English bullets enter my bowels!&rdquo; Unhappy man, thou wert reserved for French bullets!</p></div> </div>
