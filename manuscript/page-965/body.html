<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The gendarme, who is a good fellow, nudges my elbow, and says to me in a low voice, &lsquo;Come, answer!&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know how to explain; I have no education; I am a poor man; that is where they wrong me, because they do not see this. I have not stolen; I picked up from the ground things that were lying there. You say, Jean Valjean, Jean Mathieu! I don&rsquo;t know those persons; they are villagers. I worked for M. Baloup, Boulevard de l&rsquo;HÃ´pital; my name is Champmathieu. You are very clever to tell me where I was born; I don&rsquo;t know myself: it&rsquo;s not everybody who has a house in which to come into the world; that would be too convenient. I think that my father and mother were people who strolled along the highways; I know nothing different. When I was a child, they called me young fellow; now they call me old Fellow; those are my baptismal names; take that as you like.</p></div> </div>
